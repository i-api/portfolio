[programming is about data analysis,  data transformation, and data generation]

every program must do output
- write data to a file
- send data over a network
- send data to a screen for display
- send data to an audio device for playback
- etc.

most programs also do input
- read data from a file
- receive data over a network
- receive data from a mouse, keyboard, or other human input device
- etc.



[data comes in difference types]
# 1: strings ("plain text" aka sequences of text characters)
# 2: numbers (integers, real numbers, et al.)
# 3: booleans ( true or false)
# 4: collections (values made up of multiple other values)



[every programming languages...]
- built-in operations
- variables
- branching (if statements)
- looping (while / for statements)
- functions (programmer-defined operations)
- ...what about input/output?
